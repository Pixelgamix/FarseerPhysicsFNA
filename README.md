# FarseerPhysicsFNA
[FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) version of [FarseerPhysics](https://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/) based on version 3.5

## Downloading native libraries
FNA depends on some native libraries that are **not** included in this repository in order to keep the repository size small. You can either get and compile the native libraries yourself or download them from the official [FNA website](http://fna-xna.github.io/download/). After downloading them just copy the native libraries for your operating system into the build folder of the project you want to execute.
